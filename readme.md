```

### Parameter Explanations

#### Sentiment Boundaries
- **EXTREME_FEAR**: FGI value threshold for extreme fear conditions. Values below this trigger larger buy orders.
- **FEAR**: Upper threshold for fear conditions. Values between this and EXTREME_FEAR trigger smaller buy orders.
- **GREED**: Lower threshold for greed conditions. Values above this trigger sell orders.
- **EXTREME_GREED**: Threshold for extreme greed. Values above this trigger larger sell orders.

#### Trade Execution
- **MIN_PROFIT_PERCENT**: The minimum profit percentage required before the bot will close a position.
- **TRADE_COOLDOWN_MINUTES**: Enforced waiting period between trades to prevent overtrading.
- **MIN_SENTIMENT_CHANGE**: Required change in FGI value to trigger a new trade, prevents small fluctuations from causing unnecessary trades.

#### Position Sizing Systems

The bot offers two methods for calculating position sizes when opening trades:

**1. STRATEGIC Method (Default, Recommended)**
- Takes a daily snapshot of your SOL and USDC balances every 24 hours
- Uses STRATEGIC_PERCENTAGE to calculate fixed trade sizes for the next 24 hours
- Example: With STRATEGIC_PERCENTAGE of 2.5%
  - Day starts with 100 SOL and 1000 USDC
  - Each trade that day will use 2.5 SOL or 25 USDC
  - Next day, balances are re-snapshot and new trade sizes are calculated
- Provides more consistent, predictable trading sizes

**2. VARIABLE Method**
- Calculates trade size dynamically for each trade based on current balance
- Uses SENTIMENT_MULTIPLIERS as percentages of your current balance
- Example: With Extreme Fear multiplier of 0.07 (7%)
  - Current balance: 100 SOL
  - Trade size: 7 SOL (7% of current balance)
  - Next trade will use 7% of whatever the new balance is
- More aggressive, adapts to changing balances immediately

**Profit Taking (Both Methods)**
- When closing profitable trades, the bot only sells the original purchase amount
- Example:
  - Buy 10 SOL at $10 ($100 total)
  - Price rises to $15
  - Bot sells only $100 worth (6.67 SOL)
  - Keeps remaining 3.33 SOL as profit

#### Operational Settings
- **USER_MONTHLY_COST**: Used for accurate APY calculations, factoring in operational expenses
- **DEVELOPER_TIP_PERCENTAGE**: Optional percentage for developer support
- **MONITOR_MODE**: When enabled, bot will track market but not execute trades
