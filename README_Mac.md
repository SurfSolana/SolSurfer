        "EXTREME_GREED": 0.02  // Position size multiplier during extreme greed (VARIABLE mode only)

}
```

    "MONITOR_MODE": false               // Enable/disable trading (true = monitor only)
}
```

### Position Sizing Systems

The bot offers two methods for calculating position sizes when opening trades:

**1. STRATEGIC Method (Default, Recommended)**
- Takes a daily snapshot of your SOL and USDC balances every 24 hours
- Uses STRATEGIC_PERCENTAGE to calculate fixed trade sizes for the next 24 hours
- Example: With STRATEGIC_PERCENTAGE of 2.5%
  - Day starts with 100 SOL and 1000 USDC
  - Each trade that day will use 2.5 SOL or 25 USDC
  - Next day, balances are re-snapshot and new trade sizes are calculated
- Provides more consistent, predictable trading sizes

**2. VARIABLE Method**
- Calculates trade size dynamically for each trade based on current balance
- Uses SENTIMENT_MULTIPLIERS as percentages of your current balance
- Example: With Extreme Fear multiplier of 0.07 (7%)
  - Current balance: 100 SOL
  - Trade size: 7 SOL (7% of current balance)
  - Next trade will use 7% of whatever the new balance is
- More aggressive, adapts to changing balances immediately

**Profit Taking (Both Methods)**
- When closing profitable trades, the bot only sells the original purchase amount
- Example:
  - Buy 10 SOL at $10 ($100 total)
  - Price rises to $15
  - Bot sells only $100 worth (6.67 SOL)
  - Keeps remaining 3.33 SOL as profit

Before deciding to trade cryptocurrencies, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
